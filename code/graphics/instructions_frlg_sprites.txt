## Instructions for swapping the vanilla Emerald sprites of the kanto mons for the FRLG sprites:
1. stub out the function(s) at src/decompress.c#L449 : stub out gMonFrontPicTableFRLG , gMonFrontPicTableDP, or rather their contents. e.g.:
     ```
     static void SwapSprite(u16 species, u32 pid, void *dest)
     {
     }
     ```
2. These contain pointers to alternate sprites, so if I'm going to swap graphics/pokemon as a whole, they'll all be broken. If I just do a drag-and-drop overwrite keeping the extra sprites there and just stub the function, it should work fine
3. Clean clone
4. Merge/overwrite the contents of graphics/pokemon using mine.
5. make mostlyclean; make

## Fix the following mons:
 - Seaking (missing the second frame) DONE
 - Poliwag
 - Poliwhirl
 - ((I know there are more; check the pokedex))

## Fix icons:
 - Grovyle
 - Torkoal
 - Cradily
 - Iglybuf
 - Bagon
 - Xatu
 - Foretress?
 - they share palettes, check the ones sharing the same palettes as the faulty ones

## Custom sprites:
 - Scyther (merged the FRLG with the RSE one. Needs a bit of polishing)
 - Pikachu
 - LUGIA

## Sprites Im considering changing
 - Latios: Lighten up the gray colours (did a mockup a while ago) DONE
 - Smeargle: Looks a bit disturbing. Adjust the colours a bit maybe. Plus, maybe the HG/SS one?
 - Furret: Revamp of the GSC sprite. Or, change the backsprite for the backsprite in HG/SS
 - Tropius Backsprite DONE
 - Regis look tiny in the sprites
